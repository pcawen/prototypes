moreElementsInidiator.html

Shows an ellipsis-like at the end of a scrollable table indicating there are more elements hidden. Useful on mobile devices that do not shows scrollbar.

Note: It should be improved especially to avoid setting the class every time the scroll event is triggered. But it is saturday night and I think I should be doing something else.


Or you can use jQuery slimScroll
